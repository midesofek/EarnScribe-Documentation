# Problem Statement

The parabolic growth of the web3 ecosystem has brought about a wild influx of projects in the space. By virtue of their exposure, project developers are very much alert to the need to communicate their project’s functionality, aspirations, and roadmaps, and market their products to their target audience.

This is achieved through diverse forms of content creation (i.e. articles, blog posts, social media content, whitepaper documentation, code repository writeups, etc.). The ultimate idea here is that every project needs written content to fuel its product marketing campaigns and to engage with its community. However, due to limited team sizes and available resources, project developers struggle to find the best talents. In like manner, highly-skilled writers need an opportunity to connect with projects to deliver their expertise and generate income from it.

Statistically, there is a demand for highly-skilled writers and a reasonable supply of writers but what is lacking is a marketplace to bridge the gap between hirers and writers. This is the major problem **EarnScribe** seeks to solve.

Presently, the existing platforms seeking to solve this problem majorly focus on building a decentralized social media platform where creators earn rewards in cryptocurrency for creating and curating content (_Hive, Minds, Narrative, Steemit, etc_). Similar models focus on building blogging platforms where users can earn cryptocurrency by writing and reading content. They also allow users to tip content creators and earn additional rewards for referring new users(_Publish0x_).

Without a doubt, these platforms are taking care of a huge problem in the ecosystem, however, no platform has come close to bridging talents with projects in need of their skills.

### The Challenges:

1. **The Herculean Task of Hunting Quality Writers:** Hiring writers can be a time-consuming process, and project developers may struggle to balance this with their other responsibilities. This can lead to delays in the project timeline and can impact overall productivity.

Also, project developers may struggle to find writers who are the right fit for their specific project. It can be difficult to evaluate the quality of writing samples or work from potential writers.

2. **Low-Motivation for Writers**: Writers need an opportunity to get rewards for their hard-earned skills. In essence, they need some sort of motivation to perform their job effectively and consistently. Without motivation, writers may struggle to produce high-quality work, meet deadlines, and remain engaged in their writing projects.

Lack of motivation can lead to writer's block, low productivity, and burnout, which can ultimately impact the quality of their writing and their overall success as writers.

Therefore, it is important to identify and address the factors that affect writers' motivation, such as financial incentives, personal satisfaction, creative freedom, and recognition, in order to help them stay motivated and productive.

3. **Tedious Verification of Proof-of-Work / Work History:** One common headache for project developers/hirers/recruiters is having to vet the credentials of writers when making hiring decisions.

Also, writers get drowned in the time-consuming pattern of having to repeatedly submit their credentials when they seek opportunities. Now we reason, how about a model that supports writers showcasing their expertise on existing platforms like (Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode, etc) and a ranking system that boosts a writer’s score the more s/he writes quality content on these platforms.

Hirers who come to the marketplace, can easily see the works of each writer and make their decisions based on that.

4. **Remuneration Payment Issues:** Hirers may face payment disputes with writers over the amount, method, or timing of payment. These disputes can lead to delays in the project timeline and can damage the working relationship between the hirer and the writer.

In addition, there may be issues of inconsistent payment practices, such as irregular payment schedules or delayed payments; payment fraud and cross-border payments. Writers may often be limited when receiving international payments from hirers due to restrictions set by traditional payment platforms.

These challenges can be overcome with escrow smart contracts.
