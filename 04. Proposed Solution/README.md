# Proposed Solution

In addressing the stated challenges, EarnScribe hereby offers the following solutions:

1. **Light-Speed Hiring Process for Project Developers:** By leveraging advanced algorithms, EarnScribe collates writers’ activities on trusted blogging platforms and ranks writers based on their work and categorizes them based on their niche and area of expertise (e.g. Technical Writing, Storywriting, social media content, etc).

   Project developers who seek to hire these talents, simply have to hop on the platform and skim through the pool of writers and simply reach out to writers of their choice.

2. **Scalable Incentives for Writers:** To address the issues of low motivation for writers, EarnScribe provides writers with a platform to showcase their work seamlessly, get hired by projects seeking their talents and participate in sponsored content campaigns hosted by projects.

3. **Accelerated Work-History Verification:** EarnScribe incorporates a direct connection model to a writer’s working platform (Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode). EarnScribe enables writers to connect their publishing platforms to the marketplace. These publishing platforms are attached to each writer’s unique wallet address. These activities are visible to hirers who can easily verify each writer’s credentials.

4. **Hassle-Free Payment Systems:** EarnScribe utilizes blockchain technology to ensure that all transactions are secure and transparent, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring timely and accurate payments to writers. We will also provide a user-friendly interface that simplifies the payment process for clients.
