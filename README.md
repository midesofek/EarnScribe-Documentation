Introduction to EarnScribe

The Concept of Write to Earn
Write-to-earn is a concept that has emerged in recent years, reflecting the growing demand for high-quality content and the increasing number of individuals who aspire to make a living as writers.

Put simply, write-to-earn platforms allow writers to monetize their skills by writing content for businesses, individuals, or other clients, who pay them for their work.

By leveraging the power of digital technology and blockchain-based systems, write-to-earn platforms offer a more transparent, efficient, and fairer way for writers to earn a living, while also providing clients with access to a pool of talented writers who can create high-quality content that meets their specific needs.

Write-to-earn platforms can help to democratize the writing industry by removing barriers to entry and creating opportunities for talented writers from all backgrounds to showcase their skills and earn a living doing what they love.

Introduction to EarnScribe
Earnscribe is a Write-to-Earn decentralized marketplace that brings hirers, devs, recruiters and writers together in the most secure, efficient and proficient way possible.

With Earnscribe, hirers can find and easily verify the best talents for their technical content, articles, blog posts, social media content, whitepaper, documentation, etc. Hirers can also launch campaigns (such as Thread Contests, and Sponsored content campaigns to generate buzz, increase brand awareness and engage with their target audience).

Earnscribe provides writers with an opportunity to get paid for what they love doing the most, writing. Writers get connected with hirers seeking their expertise, participate in sponsored campaigns and get paid for efforts.

This system is made possible by a model that enables writers to gain visibility and get ranked by the content they share on their usual blogging platforms (i.e. Medium, Dev.to and Hashnode) and Hirers seamlessly vet these writers and hire according to their specific demands.

II. Problem Statement
Clearly define the problem that your platform aims to solve.
Explain the current state of the market and the limitations of existing solutions.
Demonstrate the need for a new write-to-earn platform.

The parabolic growth of the web3 ecosystem has brought about a wild influx of projects in the space. By virtue of their exposure, project developers are very much alert to the need to communicate their project’s functionality, aspirations, and roadmaps, and market their products to their target audience.

This is achieved through diverse forms of content creation (i.e. articles, blog posts, social media content, whitepaper documentation, code repository writeups, etc.). The ultimate idea here is that every project needs written content to fuel its product marketing campaigns and to engage with its community. However, due to limited team sizes and available resources, project developers struggle to find the best talents. In like manner, highly-skilled writers need an opportunity to connect with projects to deliver their expertise and generate income from it.

Statistically, there is a demand for highly-skilled writers and a reasonable supply of writers but what is lacking is a marketplace to bridge the gap between hirers and writers. This is the major problem EarnScribe seeks to solve.

Presently, the existing platforms seeking to solve this problem majorly focus on building a decentralized social media platform where creators earn rewards in cryptocurrency for creating and curating content (Hive, Minds, Narrative, Steemit, etc). Similar models focus on building blogging platforms where users can earn cryptocurrency by writing and reading content. They also allow users to tip content creators and earn additional rewards for referring new users(Publish0x).

Without a doubt, these platforms are taking care of a huge problem in the ecosystem, however, no platform has come close to bridging talents with projects in need of their skills.

The Challenges:

The Herculean Task of Hunting Quality Writers: Hiring writers can be a time-consuming process, and project developers may struggle to balance this with their other responsibilities. This can lead to delays in the project timeline and can impact overall productivity.
Also, project developers may struggle to find writers who are the right fit for their specific project. It can be difficult to evaluate the quality of writing samples or work from potential writers.

Low-Motivation for Writers: Writers need an opportunity to get rewards for their hard-earned skills. In essence, they need some sort of motivation to perform their job effectively and consistently. Without motivation, writers may struggle to produce high-quality work, meet deadlines, and remain engaged in their writing projects. Lack of motivation can lead to writer's block, low productivity, and burnout, which can ultimately impact the quality of their writing and their overall success as writers. Therefore, it is important to identify and address the factors that affect writers' motivation, such as financial incentives, personal satisfaction, creative freedom, and recognition, in order to help them stay motivated and productive.

Tedious Verification of Proof-of-Work / Work History: One common headache for project developers/hirers/recruiters is having to vet the credentials of writers when making hiring decisions. Also, writers get drowned in the time-consuming pattern of having to repeatedly submit their credentials when they seek opportunities. Now we reason, how about a model that supports writers showcasing their expertise on existing platforms like (Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode, etc) and a ranking system that boosts a writer’s score the more s/he writes quality content on these platforms. Hirers who come to the marketplace, can easily see the works of each writer and make their decisions based on that.

Remuneration Payment Issues: Hirers may face payment disputes with writers over the amount, method, or timing of payment. These disputes can lead to delays in the project timeline and can damage the working relationship between the hirer and the writer. Also, there may be issues of inconsistent payment practices, such as irregular payment schedules or delayed payments; payment fraud and cross-border payments. Writers may often be limited when receiving international payments from hirers due to restrictions set by traditional payment platforms. These challenges can be overcome with escrow smart contracts.

III. Our Proposed Solution
Describe our platform's solution to the problem.
Provide a detailed explanation of our platform's key features and how they will address the problem.

In addressing the stated challenges, EarnScribe hereby offers the following solutions:

1. Light-Speed Hiring Process for Project Developers: By leveraging advanced algorithms, EarnScribe collates writers’ activities on trusted blogging platforms and ranks writers based on their work and categorizes them based on their niche and area of expertise (e.g. Technical Writing, Storywriting, social media content, etc).
   Project developers who seek to hire these talents, simply have to hop on the platform and skim through the pool of writers and simply reach out to writers of their choice.

2. Scalable Incentives for Writers: To address the issues of low motivation for writers, EarnScribe provides writers with a platform to showcase their work seamlessly, get hired by projects seeking their talents and participate in sponsored content campaigns hosted by projects.

3) Accelerated Work-History Verification: EarnScribe incorporates a direct connection model to a writer’s working platform (Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode). EarnScribe enables writers to connect their publishing platforms to the marketplace. These publishing platforms are attached to each writer’s unique wallet address. These activities are visible to hirers who can easily verify each writer’s credentials.

4. Hassle-Free Payment Systems: EarnScribe utilizes blockchain technology to ensure that all transactions are secure and transparent, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring timely and accurate payments to writers. We will also provide a user-friendly interface that simplifies the payment process for clients.

A decentralized marketplace for writers and hirers.

Write To Earn Dapp - Web3Africa Hackathon
EarnScribe is

A Decentralized writing to earn application. Writers would write about projects, web3 topics and anything decentralization.

Create a model for writers to associate their socials/portfolio like twitter hashnode and any other used socials for writing and link this to their wallet address.

A pay rate can be something like \$5 / hour just giving an instance.

Hiring Managers comes see the profile of registered writers (the writers should have a status bar either available or not)

Problems on ground now is how the hiring manager would communicate with the writer on rate and any other stuff.

If an agreement is reached the payment is sent to the smart contract and the manager would confirm if it meets the requirements and the writer gets paid
